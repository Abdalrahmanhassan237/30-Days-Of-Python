'''' Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations.
 It can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. '''

# Arithmetic Operators    +, - , / ,// *, %, %%


x = -5       # Negates the value of X
z = +-x      # +(-5) ---> 5
print(z)

print(1 -- 3)   # Equivalent to 1-(-3)
print(2 --- 4)  # Equivalent to 2-(-(-3))
print(3 +-- 2)  # Equivalent to 3+(-(-2))

# Arithmetic Operator

# Addition

# it returns the result as the arithmetic sum of the operands


print(4 + 5)

# Subtraction

#  it returned as the arithmetic difference of the operands

print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication

# it returns the result as the arithmetic product of the operands

print(3 * 5)

# Division

# it returns the result as the arithmetic quotient of the operands.


print(10 / 2)
print(5.45 / 9.8)

# When the division (/) operator is applied on two int operands, Python returns a float resul

# floor Division

# it returns the result as the arithmetic quotient of the operands

print(10 // 3)     # output : 3   not 3.333333333333333333333

# modules

print(10 % 3)      # X%Y is equivalent to X â€“ Y * (x//Y)

# The Exponent ** Operator

print(2 ** 3)     # output 8
